# 100 days of code, 1 hour per day, several commits per day

Here I will be sharing the code part of the challenge #100daysofcode

My plan is based for R, Fortran and Javascript.

As I use R everyday, my plan is to initially focus on Fortran so that I can integrate it with R.

I would like to create a package in R with bindings for netcdf-fortran

however, I also would like to learn javascrip, CSS and BootStrap.

As I work with R everyday, I think I should not count R as part of the challenge, onyly if related tothe challenge.

let us begin
